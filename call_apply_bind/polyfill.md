# JavaScript Polyfills

## What is a Polyfill?

A **polyfill** is a piece of JavaScript code that provides functionality not natively supported by a web browser. Polyfills ensure that newer or standardized features work across older browsers or environments.

## Why Use Polyfills?

When new JavaScript features are introduced, not all browsers immediately implement them. Polyfills help bridge this gap, allowing developers to use the latest features while maintaining compatibility with older browsers.

## Types of Polyfills

1. **Perfect Polyfills**:

   - Fully implement a feature with no side effects.
   - Example: `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` for older browsers.

2. **Common Polyfills**:

   - Implement most of a feature with minor missing functionality or edge cases.
   - Example: Most browser compatibility polyfills.

3. **Partial Polyfills**:

   - Provide limited functionality, with many features missing or broken.
   - Example: ES5 shim for ECMAScript 3 engines.

4. **Fallback Polyfills**:
   - Do not implement the feature but provide a fallback behavior.
   - Example: Web Worker fallback, which runs multi-threaded code in a single thread in older browsers.
